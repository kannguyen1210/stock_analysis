# Stock Analysis

### Project Overview
The Analysis was based on a set of stocks and their performance in 2017 and 2018. The Excel file was included with a VBA script to assist with analyzing the data set due to the large volume of data. The VBA code will provide the total daily volumes and annual returns of selected stocks and color-coded the data to easily identify which stocks provide positive returns in 2017 and 2018.
